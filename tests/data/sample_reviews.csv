simplistic , silly and tedious .
it's so laddish and juvenile , only teenage boys could possibly find it funny .
exploitative and largely devoid of the depth or sophistication that would make watching such a graphic treatment of the crimes bearable .
[garbus] discards the potential for pathological study , exhuming instead , the skewed melodrama of the circumstantial situation .
a visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise in style and mystification .
the story is also as unoriginal as they come , already having been recycled more times than i'd care to count .
about the only thing to give the movie points for is bravado -- to take an entirely stale concept and push it through the audience's meat grinder one more time .
not so much farcical as sour .
unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script .
all the more disquieting for its relatively gore-free allusions to the serial murders , but it falls down in its attempts to humanize its subject .
a sentimental mess that never rings true .
while the performances are often engaging , this loose collection of largely improvised numbers would probably have worked better as a one-hour tv documentary .
interesting , but not compelling .
on a cutting room floor somewhere lies . . . footage that might have made no such thing a trenchant , ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire .
while the ensemble player who gained notice in guy ritchie's lock , stock and two smoking barrels and snatch has the bod , he's unlikely to become a household name on the basis of his first starring vehicle .
there is a difference between movies with the courage to go over the top and movies that don't care about being stupid
he rock is destined to be the 21st century's new " conan " and that he's going to make a splash even greater than arnold schwarzenegger , jean-claud van damme or steven segal .
the gorgeously elaborate continuation of " the lord of the rings " trilogy is so huge that a column of words cannot adequately describe co-writer/director peter jackson's expanded vision of j . r . r . tolkien's middle-earth .
effective but too-tepid biopic
if you sometimes like to go to the movies to have fun , wasabi is a good place to start .
emerges as something rare , an issue movie that's so honest and keenly observed that it doesn't feel like one .
the film provides some great insight into the neurotic mindset of all comics -- even those who have reached the absolute top of the game .
offers that rare combination of entertainment and education .
perhaps no picture ever made has more literally showed that the road to hell is paved with good intentions .
steers turns in a snappy screenplay that curls at the edges ; it's so clever you want to hate it . but he somehow pulls it off .
